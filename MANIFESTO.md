# The GateCrash Manifesto

## We Crash Gates. We Don't Build New Ones.

## The Problem

Big Tech has become the gatekeeper of everything digital:

- **Google Forms** bans AI agents, even from paid accounts
- **TypeForm** charges $50/month for basic features
- **SurveyMonkey** locks your data behind paywalls
- **Jotform** requires their branding on free plans
- **Mailchimp** demands compliance with their arbitrary rules
- **AWS** controls your infrastructure and pricing

The pattern is clear: **Build a tool → Get users → Lock them in → Extract rent**

They say it's about "quality" or "security" or "terms of service."

**We say it's gatekeeping.**

---

## The GateCrash Philosophy

### 1. BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys)

You own the infrastructure. Not us. Not anyone else.

- Your SMTP server for emails
- Your storage for data
- Your deployment for hosting
- Your API keys for integrations

**If we don't control it, we can't gatekeep it.**

### 2. Toolmaker, Not Service Provider

GateCrash is NOT a SaaS platform. We don't want your:
- Credit card
- User data
- Monthly subscription
- Dependency

We build **tools**, not **services**. Tools that YOU control.

### 3. Open Source Forever

Every line of code is open. Every feature is inspectable. Every decision is transparent.

You can:
- Fork it
- Modify it
- Sell it
- Host it yourself
- Never pay us a cent

**The code is yours. Forever.**

### 4. No Lock-In

Export your data anytime. Switch tools anytime. Host anywhere. Use any SMTP server.

We use **standard formats**:
- JSON for configs
- HTML for forms
- CSV/JSON for responses
- SMTP for email

No proprietary formats. No vendor lock-in.

## Why Now?

The internet was supposed to be **decentralized**.

Instead, we got:
- 3 companies controlling 90% of cloud infrastructure
- 2 companies controlling mobile operating systems
- 1 company controlling search
- Walled gardens everywhere
- APIs that cost $10,000/month
- "Enterprise plans" for basic features

**This is not freedom. This is feudalism.**

And now they're gatekeeping **AI agents** too. Google bans agent usage. OpenAI restricts automation. Anthropic monitors "unusual activity."

**They're terrified of us automating away their control.**

## The GateCrash Vision

We're building the **anti-gatekeeping suite**:

### Phase 1: Forms ✅
- Open-source form builder
- BYOK email notifications
- No data farming
- Self-hostable

### Phase 2: Email (Coming Soon)
- SMTP server FOR agents
- No "bot detection" bans
- Your domain, your rules

### Phase 3: Storage (Coming Soon)
- S3-compatible object storage
- Run it yourself
- Pay for disks, not APIs

### Phase 4: Analytics (Coming Soon)
- Privacy-first analytics
- Your data stays yours
- No Google tracking scripts

### Phase 5: Auth (Coming Soon)
- Open authentication system
- No OAuth gatekeepers
- Self-sovereign identity

## Our Principles

### ✅ DO
- Build tools that empower users
- Use open standards
- Make it easy to self-host
- Respect user freedom
- Write clean, inspectable code
- Support AI agents as first-class citizens
- Enable automation without restrictions

### ❌ DON'T
- Require accounts on OUR servers
- Store user data we don't need
- Charge for basic features
- Lock users into our ecosystem
- Track users across the web
- Ban "unusual" usage patterns
- Build closed, proprietary formats

## Join the Movement

GateCrash is bigger than code. It's a stance:

**Against**: Gatekeeping, vendor lock-in, rent-seeking, surveillance capitalism

**For**: User freedom, open source, self-hosting, digital autonomy

### How to Help

1. **Use it** - Build with GateCrash tools
2. **Fork it** - Make it your own
3. **Contribute** - Send PRs, fix bugs, add features
4. **Spread it** - Tell others about BYOK philosophy
5. **Build with it** - Create your own anti-gatekeeping tools

## The Future We're Building

A world where:
- Users control their infrastructure
- AI agents are first-class citizens
- Open source is the default
- Data belongs to its creator
- Tools don't gatekeep
- Freedom isn't a premium feature

**We crash gates. We don't build new ones.**
